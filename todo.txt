things to store:
num of blocks orphaned
num of blocks mined by selfish, honest miners
selfish miners reward (#blocks*reward - computational_cost*time)

1. Selfish V Honest as (alpha, gamma) change and as (window_size, time_per_block) change
    - Look at relative blocks won
    - Look at cost




- !!! account for defectors
- computational cost
- glue visualization code together (pickle results object)
- look at difficulty code (for 2-honest case. is there something buggy with agent.type?)
- pretty print terminal (progress bar + animations + emojis)
~~~- ism miner
