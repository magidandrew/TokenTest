honest and selfish miners mining blocks successfully and adding to chain, n = 10
Work out fork conditions and summation/timekeeping problem // Try to finish this by mid afternoon...
Clean up the simulation  variables... -> Selfish Mine class
Create agent classes to encapsulate and oop the sim
-------> win by EOD -> Only then can you drink.
Add "winner" function to each agent subclass
Make sim code work with agent classes.
Write tests for the simulate class.s
easily export this data to the visualizer script


things to store:
num of blocks orphaned
num of blocks mined by selfish, honest miners
selfish miners reward (#blocks*reward - computational_cost*time)



Simulation high-level overview:
keep starting window block and ending window block vars..

while len(valid-chai)<2016:
    get next block from deque
    transmit_to_all_agents
    receive_from_all_agents (they send pp-size and alterations to valid chain len)
    ...
    need logic for forks and longest chain
